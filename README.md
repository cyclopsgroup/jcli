# Introduction

JCli is a Java annotation driven command line manipulation library. Today, there are more than enough command line argument tools for Java in open source world out there. JCli distincts from others for following reasons:

* Parsing rules defined entirely by annotation.
* Customized conversion rules defined by annotation using [Caff](https://github.com/jiaqi/caff/wiki).
* Multi-value option supported.

Initially JCli was part of [Jmxterm](https://github.com/jiaqi/jmxterm) project. The command line parsing logic has been gradually decoupled and now becomes an separated library that can easily fit in other command line parsing scenarios.
